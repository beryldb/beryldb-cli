## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not report security vulnerabilities on GitHub, unless you are
required to. The recommended method to report a serious bug is by emailing
the core staff at contact@beryldb.com.

We will address your issue as soon as possible and, hopefully will release a fixed version within a
week.
